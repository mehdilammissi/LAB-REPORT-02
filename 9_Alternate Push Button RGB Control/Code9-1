/*  

  Input Pullup Serial 

 
 

  This example demonstrates how to use pinMode(INPUT_PULLUP). 

  It reads a digital input from pin 2 (connected to a pushbutton) 

  and controls three LEDs connected to pins 13, 12, and 11. 

 
 

  Unlike pinMode(INPUT), this setup doesn’t require an external pull-down resistor. 

  Instead, the Arduino’s internal ~20KΩ resistor pulls the input up to +5V. 

 
 

  As a result: 

    - The input reads HIGH (1) when the button is NOT pressed 

    - The input reads LOW (0) when the button IS pressed

void setup() {  

  // Set pin 2 as an input and activate the internal pull-up resistor   

  pinMode(2, INPUT_PULLUP);   

 
 

  // Set pins 13, 12, and 11 as outputs for controlling the LEDs   

  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);   

  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);   

  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);   

}  

 
 

void loop() {  

  // Read the button state (HIGH when not pressed, LOW when pressed)   

  int sensorVal = digitalRead(2);   

 
 

  // LED on pin 13 stays ON at all times   

  digitalWrite(13, 1);   

 
 

  // LED on pin 12 turns ON only when the button is pressed   

  digitalWrite(12, !sensorVal);   

 
 

  // LED on pin 11 turns ON only when the button is not pressed   

  digitalWrite(11, sensorVal);   

}
