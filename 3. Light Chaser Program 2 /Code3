/*This program makes LEDs connected to pins 13, 12, 11, and 10 turn ON and OFF one after another.
The main function used is digitalWrite(), which controls each pin by sending either a HIGH (1) or LOW (0) signal.
The variable 'time' determines how long each LED stays ON before the next one lights up.*/
