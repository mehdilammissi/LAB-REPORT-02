/*  

  This program makes LEDs connected to pins 13, 12, and 11 light up in sequence, one after another. 

 
 

  The key function used here is digitalWrite(), which sends either a HIGH (1) or LOW (0) signal to each pin to control the LEDs. 

 
 

  The variable 'time' sets how long each LED stays ON before the next one lights up.
