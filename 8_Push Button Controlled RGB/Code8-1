/*  

  This program reads the state of a pushbutton connected to pin 2. 

 
 

  It uses the Arduino’s internal pull-up resistor, which means: 

    - When the button is NOT pressed → the input reads HIGH (1) 

    - When the button IS pressed → the input reads LOW (0) 

 
 

  The LEDs connected to pins 13, 12, and 11 will turn ON or OFF  

  based on the pushbutton’s current state.
