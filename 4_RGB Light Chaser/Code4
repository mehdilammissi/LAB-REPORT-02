/*  

  This program controls an RGB LED connected to pins 13, 12, and 11, turning each color ON and OFF in sequence. 

 
 

  The main function used is digitalWrite(), which sends either a HIGH (1) or LOW (0) signal to each pin to control the LED states. 

 
 

  The variable 'time' defines how long each LED color stays ON before switching to the next.
