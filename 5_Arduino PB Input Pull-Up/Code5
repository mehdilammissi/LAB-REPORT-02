/*  

  This program reads a digital input signal from pin 2 and displays its state in the Serial Monitor. 

 
 

  The main function used is digitalRead(), which checks whether the pin reads a HIGH (1) or LOW (0) signal. 

 
 

  A pull-up resistor is used to ensure the input stays at a known HIGH state when the switch is open,  

  preventing the signal from “floating” or becoming unstable.

// Digital pin 2 is connected to a pushbutton. We'll give it a descriptive name: 

int pushButton = 2; 

 
 

// The setup() function runs once when the board starts or is reset: 

void setup() {  

  // Begin serial communication at 9600 bits per second to send data to the Serial Monitor 

  Serial.begin(9600);  

   

  // Set the pushbutton pin as an input 

  pinMode(pushButton, INPUT);  

}  

 
 

// The loop() function runs continuously after setup() 

void loop() {  

  // Read the state of the pushbutton and store it in the variable 'buttonState' 

  int buttonState = digitalRead(pushButton);  

   

  // Print the current state of the button to the Serial Monitor 

  Serial.print("buttonState =     ");  

  Serial.println(buttonState);  

   

  delay(1);  // Short delay between readings for stable results 

}
