/*  

  Blink — Basic LED Example 

 
 

  This simple program turns the built-in LED on and off repeatedly. 

  It’s often used as the very first test to confirm that the Arduino  

  board and programming environment are working properly. 

 
 

  The LED connected to the built-in pin (LED_BUILTIN) will: 

    - Turn ON for one second 

    - Turn OFF for one second 

    - Repeat indefinitely 

*/ 

 
 

// The setup() function runs once when the board is powered on or reset 

void setup() { 

  // Configure the built-in LED pin as an output 

  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); 

} 

 
 

// The loop() function runs continuously after setup() finishes 

void loop() { 

  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // Turn the LED ON (HIGH = 5V) 

  delay(1000);                      // Wait for 1 second 

  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // Turn the LED OFF (LOW = 0V) 

  delay(1000);                      // Wait for 1 second 

}
