/*  

  RGB LED Color Mixing 

 
 

  This program controls an RGB LED connected to pins 13 (Red), 11 (Green),  

  and 12 (Blue) using PWM signals. 

 
 

  The analogWrite() function adjusts brightness on a scale from 0–255: 

    - 0 = OFF 

    - 255 = Maximum brightness 

 
 

  By combining different brightness levels for each color channel, 

  you can create a wide range of custom colors.
